# Prompt for code quality analysis
quality_prompt = """
Analyze the following code snippet and provide a single, estimated quality score between 0 and 100.
Consider factors like complexity, maintainability, best practices, comments, error handling, and code style.
Return only the integer score.
"""

# Prompt for generated code detection
generated_code_prompt = """
Analyze this code snippet and determine if it appears to be auto-generated or scaffolded code.
Look for patterns like:
- Repetitive boilerplate structures
- Generic variable names (item1, item2, etc.)
- Auto-generated comments
- Scaffolding patterns from tools like JHipster, Yeoman, etc.
- Code generation markers

Respond with only: "GENERATED" or "MANUAL"

Based on this code sample in {language}, estimate the developer's proficiency level.
Consider:
- Code complexity and sophistication
- Use of advanced language features
- Code organization and patterns
- Best practices adherence
- Problem-solving approach

Rate from 1-10 where:
1-3: Beginner (basic syntax, simple operations)
4-6: Intermediate (good understanding, some advanced features)
7-8: Advanced (sophisticated patterns, optimization)
9-10: Expert (mastery of language, innovative solutions)
