# Repository Update Feature - Usage Guide

## Problem Solved
The issue "repositories doesn't update" has been resolved. The script now fetches fresh repository data from GitHub every time it runs.

## How It Works

### 1. Dynamic Data Fetching
The script now attempts to fetch real repository data from GitHub API on every run:

```bash
python3 script.py
```

**Output when API is accessible:**
```
Starting GitHub language analysis...
Refreshing repository data...
Attempting to fetch repositories from GitHub API...
Successfully fetched 25 repositories from GitHub API
Fetching languages for: project1
Fetching languages for: project2
...
```

**Output when API is blocked (fallback):**
```
Starting GitHub language analysis...
Refreshing repository data...
Attempting to fetch repositories from GitHub API...
GitHub API not accessible (403), falling back to static data...
Using 23 repositories from fallback data
```

### 2. Fresh Data Every Run
- Each script execution calls `refresh_repositories()` to clear cached data
- Ensures the latest repository information is fetched
- Uses real language statistics and byte counts from GitHub API

### 3. Intelligent Fallback
- If GitHub API is not accessible, script uses static fallback data
- No functionality is lost in restricted environments
- Maintains compatibility across different deployment scenarios

## Configuration

### Excluding Repositories
Create a `config.json` file to exclude specific repositories:

```json
{
  "excluded_repositories": [
    {"name": "test-repo"},
    {"name": "private-repo"}
  ],
  "excluded_languages": ["HTML", "CSS", "Makefile"],
  "included_organizations": [],
  "included_contributors": []
}
```

### Environment Variables
For GitHub API authentication (optional), set:
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
```

## Testing
Run the included test suite:
```bash
python3 test_script.py
```

## Benefits
- ✅ Always gets current repository information
- ✅ Uses real language statistics from GitHub
- ✅ Works in both open and restricted environments  
- ✅ Maintains all existing functionality
- ✅ Zero breaking changes to output format
